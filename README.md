# CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION

ðŸ”¹ Project Summary: Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

In this project, i built a machine learning model to predict the price of used cars and new cars based on their attributes such as brand, year, engine size, fuel type, transmission, mileage, condition, and model.

âœ… Process:

Collected & prepared data from a CSV file containing car details.

Cleaned the dataset by dropping irrelevant columns (Car ID), handling missing values, and performing feature engineering (e.g., car age).

Encoded categorical variables (Brand, Fuel Type, Transmission, Condition) using one-hot encoding.

Scaled numeric features for consistency.

Trained multiple models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Evaluated models using RÂ² and RMSE to measure accuracy and error.

Selected Random Forest Regressor as the best-performing model.

Generated predictions for car prices given new input data and predict

ðŸŽ¯ Uses & Applications

Helps buyers and sellers determine fair market prices for used cars.

Can be integrated into online car resale platforms to suggest prices automatically.

Useful for dealerships and finance companies to estimate car value for loans or trade-ins.

Provides a data-driven approach instead of manual guesswork.

Can be extended into a web app or API where users enter car details and instantly get a predicted price.
